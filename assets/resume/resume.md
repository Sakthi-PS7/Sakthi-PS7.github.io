## **Work Experience**

### **Movement Neuroscience Lab** — *Firmware Intern*  
*Boston, MA | Jun 2025 – Present*  
- Developed hard real-time plugins in **C++** within the Real Time Experimental Interface, enhancing understanding of data flow and latency-sensitive control structures essential for firmware validation and embedded system development.  
- Engineered the streaming of real-time data over **TCP** from a server to PC, ensuring low latency and reliable delivery, aligning with rigorous unit testing and integration test practices in communication system protocols.  

### **Northeastern University** — *Teaching Assistant*  
*Boston, MA | Jun 2025 – Aug 2025*  
- Mentored 10+ students in assembling **RISC-V single-cycle processors** on **TUL PYNQ Z2** boards using **Xilinx Vivado**, reinforcing low-level hardware-software integration required for device driver development.  
- Conducted weekly sessions on **digital logic fundamentals** — ALUs, register files, memory units, and instruction decoders — bridging theoretical concepts with practical embedded system implementation.  

### **Emertxe** — *Embedded and IoT Engineer Intern*  
*Bangalore, India | Jan 2023 – Jun 2023*  
- Designed a **Bash-based system monitoring tool** in Linux to automate CPU, memory, and disk usage data collection every 2 hours, improving visibility into resource utilization.  
- Built a **low-cost ($15) real-time health monitoring system** using **ESP32**, **MAX30102**, and **OLED**, measuring **SpO2**, **BPM**, and **body temperature**, storing data in **ThingSpeak Cloud** for remote patient tracking.

## **Projects**

### **Various Architecture Benchmarking (C, ARM_v8, x86_64, Linux)**  
*Sep 2025 – Oct 2025*  
- Benchmarked **Dhrystone** across **ARMv8** and **x86_64**, profiled with **GPROF**, and analyzed assembly-level hotspots.  
- Optimized **LINPACK** on x86-64 by experimenting with compiler flags, **BLAS/math libraries**, and **FP extensions**.  
- Produced comparative ISA analysis by compiling Dhrystone basic blocks for ARMv8 vs x86 and explaining each instruction.  

### **Development of OS Primitives (C, Linux, SSH)**  
*Feb 2025 – Mar 2025*  
- Built a **Bare-Metal OS implementation in C**, creating custom system call wrappers (read, write, exit), ELF executable loader, and dynamic memory management using **mmap**.  
- Implemented **multi-threaded context switching** and **stack allocation (4096-byte stacks)** to enable yield-based task scheduling.  

### **Reliable Data Transfer Protocol (C++, WSL, SSH, Vim)**  
*Oct 2024 – Dec 2024*  
- Implemented **Alternating Bit** and **Go-Back-N** protocols in **C++**, achieving 95%+ packet delivery rates under varied network loss/corruption conditions.  
- Conducted performance analysis across **1000+ transmissions** and **6+ network scenarios**, ensuring protocol correctness through checksum validation and timeout mechanisms.
